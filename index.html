                <p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the 
                    relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals 
                    such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the 
                    cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously 
                    adapted to regional tastes. Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of 
                    ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, 
                    among many others.</p>
